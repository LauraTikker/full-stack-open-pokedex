Java
Linting tools that can be used to check for mistakes and bugs in Java are CheckStyle, FindBugs, PMD and SonarLint. To test an application written in Java, JUnit testing framework can be used for unit testing. Additionally, TestNG framework can also be used that allows to write unit, end-to-end and integration tests. To write automated user interface tests Selenium framework is recommended. To build a Java application, the most used tools are probably Gradle and Maven.
Besides Jenkins and Github Actions, also Gitlab provides a simple and free (to my knowledge) cloud-hosted option for the CI. Additionally, Bamboo is a self-hosted option that can be used but the setup is somewhat more difficult/longer but allows more options and tools. Another options would be CircleCI, TeamCity or Buddy.
If an application is small, there are only few people contributing to the code, the project is not long (it is known from the beginning that the code would not be updated or maintained after few months), and there arenâ€™t many end-users, a cloud-hosted CI is easier and faster option. However, when the application gets bigger, there are many different applications to manage or the applications belong to corporation, a self-hosted environment for the CI would be a better option.
